Traveling Salesman Problem
Started Work on 11-27-18

  This program finds two solutions to the Traveling Salesperson's Problem.
  The TSP tries to solve the problem in which a traveling salesperson has to visit a list
  of cities and return to the one they started in as efficiently as possible  (a.k.a 
  travel the least amount of distance to do a circuit). This kind of path is called a 
  Hamaliton Circuit. 
 
  In the first solution we will try a brute force approach in which the all the possible
  circuits are found with their distances. The shortest circuit is then picked. In the second 
  approach, a minimum spanning tree will be constructed to find a close but not exact 
  solution to the problem. The MST algorithm will be much faster though. 
 
  A menu is presented in which the user can select a histogram or to find the shortest 
  circuit if they provide a starting city. Both algorithms will be used to find the 
  shortest path, and their results and paths printed on the screen.

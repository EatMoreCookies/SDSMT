Weekly assignments for csc315

For the first bug:
- x can between 0 and 99 inclusive and y can be between 0 and 2 inclusive. 
  The error occurs when y = 0 and we try to divide whatever number x is 
  by 0. This causes an error, causing the program to crash. I looked at the code
  and ran the program several times to figure out what was wrong with it.

## Problem
Due to COVID-19. We need to create an app that will count the number of customers entering and exiting our store. Upon app launch, the user will input the number of customers allowed in the store. After inputing the number of customers allowed, the user will a '+' button when a customer enters the store and a '-' button when a customer leaves. The app will alert the user when the max number of customers has been met, but it will allow the user to keep adding and subtracting them.

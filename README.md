# SDSMT
This is code that I have written during my time at South Dakota School of Mines and Technology.

# Warning!
This repository is public, so employers may review the code that I have written. Some of this code
may still be relevent for SDSMT students for their projects. I do not give my approval or consent
for these students to download my code and use it in their projects, unless they get express approval
from me and their professors.


Thank you!&nbsp
